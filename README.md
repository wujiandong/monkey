Learn to write an interpreter according to https://interpreterbook.com

My implementation of the üêµ language interpreter following the book. Not everything is followed, I take some liberty to not follow the book regarding naming and some logic.

My take of the book: The author has some experience in Go, but he does not seem to be an expert in Go. However, it had been fun to follow step-by-step how to construct an interpreter.
